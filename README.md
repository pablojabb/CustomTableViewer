# CTV (Custom Table Viewer)

## Description

CTV is a browser extension designed to help students instantly visualize their schedules by extracting table data from the university’s system (Pre-Registration & Schedule Pages) and transforming it into a well-structured timetable. It automatically detects conflicts, highlights overlapping time slots, and presents the schedule in a clearer format. This removes the hassle of manually checking for conflicts, allowing students to resolve issues quickly and plan their time better—without long waiting times or unnecessary stress.
